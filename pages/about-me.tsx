          <p className="pt-[10px] pb-[10px]">
            I&#39;m currently a front-end engineer at Remote. I enjoy working on React and all
            things JavaScript/TypeScript and am a big believer in the functional programming
            paradigm â€” lately, I&#39;ve been interested in learning Elixir.
          </p>
          <p className="pt-[10px] pb-[10px]">
            I&#39;m a self-taught developer with a degree in Metallurgy and Materials from NIT
            Warangal (psst, my alma mater&#39;s was the first big website I worked on!). I&#39;ve
            been fascinated by computers and the internet from around 8th grade when I used Google
            for the first time.
          </p>
          <p className="pt-[10px] pb-[10px]">
            In the past, I&#39;ve worked extensively with Python and the Google Cloud Platform, and
            been responsible for python and UI rewrites. I&#39;ve continued working with React and
            TypeScript since then and love the experiece, along with a bunch of other tooling â€” I
            firmly believe in developer tooling which allows one to become a 1.1x developer . ðŸ˜‰
          </p>
          <p className="pt-[10px] pb-[10px]">
            Outside of the world of programming, I am also a quizzer and was the lead at my
            college&#39;s Quiz Club. Having played a lot of CS in my childhood and college, I also
            love following the CS:GO esports scene. I enjoy using mechanical keyboards and lurk r/mk
            pretty much daily. I enjoy just about all genres of music and podcasts and am always
            looking for more ways to consume information from around the world.
